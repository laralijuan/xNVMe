Changelog
=========

The repository is tagged using semantic versioning, e.g. ``v1.2.3``.

Each upcoming release is available, as is, with its history subject to change,
on a branch named ``rX.Y.Z``. Once released, the history of ``rX.Y.Z`` is fixed
and tagged ``vX.Y.Z`` and pushed to the master branch.

The history from one patch-version to another is likely to be rebased. E.g.
squashed into the history of the previous until the next minor release is made.

Changes are described in this file in a section named matching the version tag.

The "Backlog" section describe changes on the roadmap for xNVMe.

Known Issues
------------

* Fabrics

  - Errors are observed when constructing payloads with an mdts exceeding
    16 * 1024 bytes. Thus a work-around is applied bounding the derived
    ``mdts_nbytes`` associated with the device geometry.

* ``be::spdk``

  - Does not build on Alpine Linux

* ``be::lioc``

  - Does not support command-option ``XNVME_CMD_ASYNC``


v0.0.19
-------

* Third-party libraries

  - Updated to liburing/v0.7, SPDK/v20.07, fio/v3.21
  - Adjusted patches and build-system to changes

* Updated docs and scripts for CI via GitHUB Actions

* Updated support for the NVMe Simple-Copy-Command (SCC)
  - Targeting TP 2020.05.04 (Ratified)
  - Added ``tests/scc.c`` testing for SCC-support, print identify fields, and
    exercises the command itself

v0.0.18
-------

* Third-party libraries: SPDK

  - Updated tracking of SPDK to current master(7dbaf54bf) and adjusted linkage
  - Removed patches that are now upstream
  - Updated nvmf/IOCS support

* Fixed non-IOCS device identification

v0.0.17
-------

* Third Party libraries

  - The organization of these has changed such that tracking them and applying
    patches is easier
  - The versions / git-revision info from bundled libraries bundled can now be
    queried via the api calls 'xnvme_3p_ver_*()'
  - The CLI tool 'xnvme' produces these upon request via 'xnvme library-info'
  - Most of the third-party libraries have been updated to, at the time of
    writing, latest versions

* The xNVMe fio IO engine

  - It now supports Zoned Devices!
    It does so by mapping the Zoned Command Set to the ZBD Kernel abstraction
  - It now supports multiple devices!
    Minor caveat; when using multiple-devices then one cannot mix backends
  - The engine was developed against fio-3.20, other versions might pose issues
    with the IO-engine interface leading to segfaults when running or just
    exiting. It should now produce a meaningful error-message when this
    happens.

* be:liou, the io_uring backend

  - Added opcode-checking via the "new" probing feature
  - Replaced READV/WRITEV with READ/WRITE
  - Build of ``be::liou`` on Alpine Linux

* Added ``be::laio`` the Linux/libaio backend

  - A great supplement to the IOCTL, io_uring, and SPDK backends

* Added initial support for NVMe-oF / Fabrics

  - xnvme_dev_open(): 'uri' argument on the form: "fab:<HOST>:<PORT>?nsid=xyz"
  - xnvme_enumerate(): 'sys_uri' argument on the form "fab:<HOST>:<PORT>"
  - Command-line utility: 'xnvme enum' takes '--uri "fab:<HOST>:<PORT>"'
  - See the "docs/tutorial/fabrics.rst" for details

* Added support for I/O Command Set

  - Convenience functions to retrieve command-set specific identity
  - Misc. definitions in the ``libxnvme_spec.h`` headers
  - Utilization of these via the CLI tools ``xnvme`` and ``lblk``

* Added support for Namespace Types (TP 4056 2020-03-05) [verified]

  - Patched SPDK to allow Command Set Selection
  - Added identifier option "?css=0xHEX" for Controller Configuration

* Added support for the Zoned Command Set

  - Support is encapsulated in the library header 'libznd.h'
  - Convenience functions for Zoned Commands
    For example: znd_cmd_mgmt_send(), znd_cmd_mgmt_send(), znd_cmd_append()
    Helpers for retrieving zone-reports with and with descriptor extensions
  - Support in fio via the xNVMe fio I/O Engine
  - CLI tool 'zoned' for convenient command-line management/inspection of zoned
    devices

* Added handling of extended-LBA

  - Expanded ``geometry`` with ``lba_extended`` informing whether
    extended-LBAs are in effect. That is, when ``flbas.bit4`` is set AND the
    current ``lbaf.ms`` is not zero.
  - Expanded ``geometry`` with ``lba_nbytes``, which will always contain the
    size of an LBA in bytes. When ``lba_extended`` is cleared to zero, then
    ``lba_nbytes`` is ``lbaf.ds``, in bytes, when ``lba_extended`` is set to 1,
    then ``lba_nbytes`` is ``lbaf.ds + lbaf.ms``.
  - When ``lba_extended`` is cleared to 0 then the API I/O helpers expect to be
    passed ``dbuf``, and ``mbuf``. When ``lba_extended`` is set to 1, then the
    API I/O helpers expect ``dbuf`` to contain data and meta-data, and expect
    ``mbuf`` to be ``NULL``.

* And a bunch of fixes
  - xnvmec: fixed errno assignment and decode
  - be: added comment on failed attempt at _blockdevice_geometry()
  - Fixed a build-issue on ARM
  - Updated backend documentation and added link to online docs in README

v0.0.16
-------

* Initial public release of xNVMe

Backlog
-------

* Release User-space NVMe Meta-filesystem

* docs

  - Expand documentation on Fabrics setup
  - Expand library usage examples

* For the Linux Kernel backends ``be:{lioc,liou}`` replace device enumeration
  with the encapsulations provided by``libnvme``

* build

  - Provide convenient means of probing source origin e.g. repos, tarball etc.
